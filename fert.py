    "10:10:10 NPK": "This is a balanced fertilizer containing equal proportions of Nitrogen (10%), Phosphorus (10%), and Potassium (10%). Nitrogen promotes lush, green foliage and vigorous stem growth. Phosphorus encourages strong root development and aids in flowering and fruiting. Potassium enhances overall plant health, improves disease resistance, and supports water regulation. Ideal for general-purpose feeding across various stages of plant growth.",

    "10:26:26 NPK": "This NPK blend contains 10% Nitrogen, 26% Phosphorus, and 26% Potassium. It is particularly effective during the reproductive stages of plants. The lower Nitrogen content reduces excessive vegetative growth, while the high Phosphorus supports strong root development and flower formation. Potassium boosts immunity, increases drought resistance, and improves fruit size and quality.",

    "12:32:16 NPK": "Comprising 12% Nitrogen, 32% Phosphorus, and 16% Potassium, this fertilizer is ideal for early plant growth. Nitrogen promotes healthy leaves and stem development. The elevated Phosphorus supports robust root systems and energy transfer, which is critical during early growth stages. Potassium enhances stress tolerance and encourages quality fruit development.",

    "13:32:26 NPK": "Contains 13% Nitrogen, 32% Phosphorus, and 26% Potassium. This combination is suitable for the flowering and fruiting phase. Nitrogen aids moderate vegetative growth, Phosphorus ensures efficient root and flower development, and Potassium strengthens plant structure, enhances sugar synthesis, and improves yield quality.",

    "18:46:00 NPK": "This fertilizer has 18% Nitrogen, 46% Phosphorus, and no Potassium. It is predominantly used at planting time to establish strong roots. Nitrogen supports early shoot growth, while the high Phosphorus level significantly boosts root formation, seedling establishment, and flowering. The absence of Potassium means it should be supplemented later if needed.",

    "19:19:19 NPK": "A well-balanced fertilizer with equal proportions of all three nutrients. Nitrogen (19%) drives vegetative growth, Phosphorus (19%) promotes root health and reproductive processes, and Potassium (19%) improves plant immunity and stress resistance. Ideal for general maintenance and suitable across various crop types.",

    "20:20:20 NPK": "Another fully balanced fertilizer with 20% of each major nutrient. It promotes healthy and even plant development across foliage, root, and reproductive systems. Best used in vegetative stages or as a foliar spray for overall health enhancement.",

    "50:26:26 NPK": "Extremely high in Nitrogen (50%), this fertilizer rapidly stimulates green vegetative growth, making it ideal for leafy crops. The substantial Phosphorus (26%) and Potassium (26%) contents ensure adequate root support and disease resistance, though care must be taken due to the high Nitrogen concentration to prevent overgrowth or burning.",

    "Ammonium Sulphate": "A rich source of Nitrogen (21%) and Sulfur (24%), it is particularly beneficial for crops requiring high Nitrogen during early stages. It supports chlorophyll production, enhances leaf growth, and corrects Sulfur deficiencies that can stunt plant development.",

    "Chilated Micronutrient": "A mixture of essential trace elements like Zinc, Iron, Copper, Manganese, and Boron in chelated form. Chelation improves nutrient absorption and prevents deficiency symptoms such as yellowing, poor flowering, and stunted growth. Important for overall plant vitality and enzyme function.",

    "DAP": "Diammonium Phosphate contains about 18% Nitrogen and 46% Phosphorus. It is a starter fertilizer used during planting to promote early root growth and support strong crop establishment. Also helps in energy transfer and seedling vigor.",

    "Ferrous Sulphate": "A source of Iron (Fe), essential for chlorophyll synthesis and enzyme function. It helps correct iron deficiency (chlorosis), especially in high pH soils where Iron availability is low. Encourages lush green foliage and healthy plant metabolism.",

    "Hydrated Lime": "Used to raise soil pH and reduce soil acidity, making nutrients more available to plants. It also adds Calcium to the soil, improving cell wall strength and reducing toxicity from heavy metals in acidic soils.",

    "MOP": "Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride) is a widely used potassium fertilizer. It improves plant resilience to disease, enhances root growth, and supports flowering and fruiting. Often used in crops that tolerate chloride well, like maize and sugarcane.",

    "Magnesium Sulphate": "Also known as Epsom Salt, it supplies Magnesium and Sulfurâ€”both crucial for photosynthesis and protein synthesis. Magnesium is the core element in chlorophyll, while Sulfur enhances enzyme and vitamin production.",

    "SSP": "Single Super Phosphate provides readily available Phosphorus (16-22%) along with Calcium and Sulfur. It stimulates root development, flower and fruit formation, and supports the microbial activity in the soil.",

    "Sulphur": "Essential for the synthesis of amino acids, enzymes, and vitamins. It helps in root development, protein formation, and chlorophyll production. Sulfur-deficient plants often exhibit pale leaves and stunted growth.",

    "Urea": "Contains a high concentration of Nitrogen (46%), making it one of the most efficient nitrogenous fertilizers. It accelerates leafy growth and is commonly applied during early vegetative stages. Requires proper soil incorporation to minimize nitrogen loss.",

    "White Potash": "A refined form of Potassium fertilizer, usually Potassium Sulphate. It improves drought resistance, flower development, and fruit quality while supplying Sulfur. Preferred for chloride-sensitive crops like tobacco, potato, and grapes."
